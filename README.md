# What is git?

> Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in any set of files, originally designed for coordinating work among programmers cooperating on source code during software development.

A system for version control. A collection of snapshots of your project over time.

# Purpose of this repository

This is a collection of information to supplement a live session in zoom. If you didn't attend the session you can read up on each subject by following the links.

We would like to demistify `git` a little bit, so it is less magical, but more concrete for you what it actually does.

## We will talk about:

- [Visualise](http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/) what a series of commits looks like
- The difference between ["local" and "remote"](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16408515/15098171)
- What happens if you ["checkout"](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-checkout) a branch or commit `git checkout`
- What is ["staging"](https://dev.to/sublimegeek/git-staging-area-explained-like-im-five-1anh) or the "stage"
- What is [HEAD](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/glossary/head/)
- What are merge conflicts and how to resolve them

## Tasks

You can use this repository as a template to create your own and play around with `git`. We have prepared some small tasks to get you started.

### There are two branches to help illustrate some hurdles:

- `feature1` has a merge conflict
- `feature2` is to demonstrate how different changes can live on different branches
